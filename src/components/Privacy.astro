		<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
		<p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 2025</p>

		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>
			This Privacy Policy describes how DB Atelier ("we", "us", "our") handles
			information in connection with our desktop application and website
			(collectively, the "Services"). We are committed to transparency about our
			data practices.
		</p>

		<h2>Data Collection</h2>
		<p>
			DB Atelier does not collect, store, or process any personal data. The
			application does not include analytics, telemetry, or any form of data
			collection. Your databases, queries, and all other content remain entirely
			on your device.
		</p>

		<h2>Payment Processing</h2>
		<p>
			All payment-related data is handled by our payment processor and Merchant of
			Record, <a href="https://www.paddle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paddle.com</a>,
			in accordance with their own
			<a href="https://www.paddle.com/legal/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">privacy policy</a>.
			We do not have access to your payment details beyond what is shown in the
			Paddle merchant dashboard (e.g., email address, transaction history).
		</p>

		<h2>AI Features</h2>
		<p>
			DB Atelier offers optional AI-powered features that require you to provide
			your own API key. These features are entirely opt-in. Your API key is stored
			locally on your device and is never transmitted to us. When you use AI
			features, requests are sent directly from your device to the AI provider. We
			have no access to your API key, your queries, or the responses you receive.
			You are responsible for your own usage and any costs incurred with your AI
			provider.
		</p>

		<h2>Cookies</h2>
		<p>
			Our website does not use cookies or similar tracking technologies.
		</p>

		<h2>Third Party Services</h2>
		<p>
			Other than Paddle for payment processing and the AI providers you choose to
			configure, DB Atelier does not share any data with third parties.
		</p>

		<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
		<p>
			We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be
			posted on this page with an updated revision date.
		</p>

		<h2>Contact</h2>
		<p>
			If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at
