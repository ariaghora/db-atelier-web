		<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
		<p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 2025</p>

		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>
			Please read these Terms of Service carefully before accessing or using our
			website. Throughout the site and other platforms (the "Site" and the
			"Services"), the terms "we", "us" and "our" refer to DB Atelier. DB Atelier
			offers this website and the applications, including all information, tools
			and services available from us. By accessing or using any part of the site
			and services, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms",
			"Terms and Conditions").
		</p>
		<p>
			These Terms of Service apply to all users of the site and the services. If
			you do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this agreement, then you
			may not access the website or use any services.
		</p>

		<h2>Section 1 — General Terms</h2>
		<p>
			By agreeing to these Terms of Service, you represent that you are at least
			the age of majority in your state or province of residence, or that you are
			the age of majority in your state or province of residence and you have
			given us your consent to allow any of your minor dependents to use this
			site.
		</p>
		<p>
			You may not use our products for any illegal or unauthorized purpose nor may
			you, in the use of the Service, violate any laws in your jurisdiction
			(including but not limited to copyright laws).
		</p>
		<p>You must not transmit any worms or viruses or any code of a destructive nature.</p>
		<p>
			A breach or violation of any of the Terms will result in an immediate
			termination of your Services.
		</p>
		<p>
			We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.
		</p>
		<p>
			You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any
			portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service or any
			contact on the website through which the service is provided, without
			express written permission by us.
		</p>
		<p>
			The headings used in this agreement are included for convenience only and
			will not limit or otherwise affect these Terms.
		</p>

		<h2>Section 2 — Registration & License Account</h2>
		<p>
			Certain of the Services or portions of the Site may require you to register
			for a License, becoming a "Registered User". As part of the License creation
			process, you may be asked to provide an email unique to the Account ("Login
			Information"). You are responsible for the confidentiality and use of your
			Login Information and agree not to transfer or disclose your Login
			Information to any third party other than an individual with express
			authority to act on your behalf. If you suspect any unauthorized use of your
			Account, you agree to notify us immediately. You are solely responsible for
			any activities occurring under your Account. You have no ownership right to
			your Account.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you are registering an Account on behalf of an organization under an
			agreement between us and another organization, that organization may have
			administrator rights to access your account and any information provided
			under your Account. If the terms of your Account or subscription grant
			access to the Services to a certain number of persons (each an "Authorized
			User"), you represent and warrant that only Authorized Users shall have
			access to the Services. These Terms will apply to each Authorized User, and
			a breach of these Terms by an Authorized User will entitle us to terminate
			your Account with no refund due to you for any prepaid subscription fees.
		</p>

			works or improvements of any Services; (b) rent, lease, lend, sell,

		<h2>Section 5 — Third Party Sites</h2>

			Websites, you do so at your own risk and waive any and all claims against us
			regarding the Third Party Websites or our links thereto.
		</p>

		<h2>Section 6 — User Content Generally</h2>
		<p>
			When you post content and information to the Site or in connection with the
			Services ("User Content", but the term User Content excludes data you create
			using the Services and any database query code written by you to be used
			with the Services, as you will retain rights to such data), you represent
			and warrant to us that (1) you own or have rights to use the User Content,
			(2) the posting of the User Content does not violate any rights of any
			person or entity, and (3) you have no agreement with or obligations to any
			third party that would prohibit your use of the Site or Services in the
			manner so used.
		</p>
		<p>
			You agree to pay all royalties, fees, and any other monies owing to any
			person or entity by reason of any User Content posted by you to the Site or
			through the Services. By posting User Content, you give us and our
			affiliates right to use and display such User Content in such manner as is
			necessary to provide the Services to you; provided that this right shall not
			give us any ownership or other rights in the User Content.
		</p>
		<p>
			Please note that if you provide us with feedback or suggestions regarding
			the Site or the Services, you grant us an unlimited, royalty-free,
			perpetual, sublicensable, transferable, worldwide, irrevocable license to
			use such suggestions or feedback without providing you with any attribution
			or compensation to you for the same.
		</p>

		<h2>Section 7 — User Conduct</h2>
		<p>
			You agree not to use the Site or the Services to take any action or actions
			that (including with respect to any User Content): (1) are patently
			offensive in any manner (as determined in our sole discretion), (2) involve
			commercial activities without our prior written consent, such as contests or
			sweepstakes, (3) are contrary to our public image, goodwill, or reputation,
			(4) infringe on our or any third party's intellectual property rights, (5)
			violate any law or any third party's legal rights, or (6) "frame" or
			"mirror" any part of the Site without our prior written consent.
		</p>

		<h2>Section 8 — Your Privacy</h2>
		<p>
			DB Atelier does not collect, store, or process any personal data. All

			email address, transaction history). The application itself does not include
			analytics, telemetry, or any form of data collection.
		</p>
		<p>
			DB Atelier offers optional AI-powered features that require you to provide
			your own API key. These features are entirely opt-in. Your API key is stored
			locally on your device and is never transmitted to us. When you use AI
			features, requests are sent directly from your device to the AI provider. We
			have no access to your API key, your queries, or the responses you receive.
			You are responsible for your own usage and any costs incurred with your AI
			provider.
		</p>

		<h2>Section 9 — Paid Services</h2>
		<p>
			Our order process is conducted by our online reseller Paddle.com. Paddle.com
			is the Merchant of Record for all our orders. Paddle provides all customer
			service inquiries and handles returns.
		</p>

		<h2>Section 10 — Copyright Infringement</h2>
		<p>
			We respect the intellectual property rights of others. The Digital Millennium
			Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA") provides a complaint procedure for
			copyright owners who believe that website material infringes their rights
			under U.S. copyright law. If you believe that your work has been improperly
			copied and posted on the website, please provide us with the following
			information: (1) name, address, telephone number, email address and an
			electronic or physical signature of the copyright owner or of the person
			authorized to act on his/her behalf; (2) a description of the copyrighted
			work that you claim has been infringed; (3) a description of where on the
			Site the material that you claim is infringing is located; (4) a written
			statement that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not
			authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (5) a
			statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information
			in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or
			authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.
		</p>

		<h2>Section 11 — Warranty Disclaimer</h2>
		<p>
			You agree that the Services are available on an "as is" basis, without any
			warranty, and that you use the Services at your own risk. We disclaim, to
			the maximum extent permitted by law, any and all warranties, whether express
			or implied, including, without limitation, (a) warranties of
			merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, (b) warranties against
			infringement of any third party intellectual property or proprietary rights,
			(c) warranties relating to delays, interruptions, errors, or omissions in
			the Services or on the Site, (d) warranties relating to the accuracy or
			correctness of data on the Services, and (e) any other warranties otherwise
			relating to our performance, nonperformance, or other acts or omissions. We
			do not warrant that the Site or the Services will operate error-free. Some
			jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain categories
			of damages or implied warranties; therefore, the above limitations may not
			apply to you. In such jurisdictions, our liability is limited to the
			greatest extent permitted by law.
		</p>

		<h2>Section 12 — Limitation of Liability</h2>
		<p>
			In no event shall DB Atelier or its suppliers, or its respective officers,
			directors, employees, or agents be liable with respect to the website or the
			services or the subject matter of this Terms of Services under any contract,
			negligence, tort, strict liability or other legal or equitable theory (i)
			for any amount in the aggregate in excess of the greater of $100 or the fees
			paid by you for the services and any products or services purchased through
			the services during the 12-month period preceding the applicable claim; (ii)
			for any indirect, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages of any kind
			whatsoever; (iii) for data loss or cost of procurement of substitute goods
			or services; or (iv) for any matter beyond DB Atelier's reasonable control.
		</p>

		<h2>Section 13 — Indemnification</h2>
		<p>
			You agree to indemnify and hold harmless us, our affiliates and our and
			their officers, directors, partners, agents, and employees from and against
			any loss, liability, claim, or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees

			your use of the Site and Services in violation of these Terms, any breach of
			the representations and warranties you make in these Terms, your User
			Content, or any corruption of or damage to your Databases resulting from
			your use of the Services. You agree to be solely responsible for defending
			any Claims against or suffered by us, subject to our right to participate
			with counsel of our own choosing.
		</p>

		<h2>Section 14 — Miscellaneous</h2>
		<p>
			We may assign, transfer, delegate, or otherwise hypothecate our rights under
			these Terms in our sole discretion. If we fail to enforce a provision of
			these Terms, you agree that such a failure does not constitute a waiver to
			enforce the provision (or any other provision hereunder). If any provision of
			these Terms is held or made invalid, the invalidity does not affect the
			remainder of these Terms. We reserve all rights not expressly granted in
			these Terms and disclaim all implied licenses.
		</p>
